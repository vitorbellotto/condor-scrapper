This project aims to scrap Condor airlines website to get the cheapest price possible for a flight ticket.

This code requires python2.7. 

For now, the code is run from the airline.py module. There the user can use as input:
        - Company
        - Depature airport
        - Arrival airport

As the repository name says, this is only a scrapper for condor, but soon I intend to add other airline companies that have routes connecting German to Brazil and vice-versa. So far, for what I found out, Lufthansa, Condor and TAP are the only companies that offer some route.
